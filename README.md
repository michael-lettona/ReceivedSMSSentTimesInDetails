Show sent times of received SMSes in the details box (on Samsung phones)
========================================================================

As the above says. It won't work on MMSes because I don't have any MMSes to test on.

This works fine if CscFeature_Message_DisplaySmsTimeAs is set, but there's no point to using this then, as you'll just have two fields with the same information.
